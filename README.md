# â˜• Spring-Boot-Application(WIP)

This is a Spring Boot-based API project that I'm building by following a YouTube video series. The project is currently under development and serves as a learning exercise for understanding how to build RESTful APIs using Spring Boot.

## Features (Planned/In Progress)

- RESTful endpoints
- Integration with a database
- Basic CRUD operations
- More features to be added as the series progresses

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code)
3. Run the `main` method in the application class

## Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress
